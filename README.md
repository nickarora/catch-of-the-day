# Catch of the Day

This application was built as an exploration of ES6 and ReactJS.  It is a real-time app for a fake seafood market, where price and quantity available are variable and can change at a moment's notice. The app features an editable menu, an order form, and an inventory management area where authorized users can immediately update product details.

# Usage
To run locally run `gulp` from the command line
